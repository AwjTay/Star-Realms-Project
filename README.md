# Star-Realms-Project

A score counting application.

## Running tests

```sh
python -m unittest test
```

## Homework

Complete tests for all of the ouput

### Extra credit

Transform this program so that the first question it asks is *how many players*, and then write a test which tests for the third player's score.
